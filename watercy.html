<h2><em>Water is a vital resource that exists in three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (vapor).<br>
 The water cycle, or hydrological cycle, <br>
describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth’s surface. <br>
It begins with evaporation, where water from oceans, rivers, <br>
and lakes turns into vapor due to the sun’s heat. <br>
Transpiration from plants also adds water vapor to the atmosphere. <br>
As the vapor rises and cools, condensation occurs, forming clouds that eventually lead to precipitation<br>
 in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water infiltrates the ground,<br>
 recharging aquifers, while the rest flows as runoff into rivers and oceans.<br>
 The cycle is crucial for distributing fresh water, regulating climate, and <br>	
 sustaining ecosystems worldwide.</h2></em>
